# 🚀 SHIFT REPORTING SCHEMA DEPLOYMENT GUIDE

## ❗ IMPORTANT: Manual Deployment Required

Since API deployment failed, please follow these steps to deploy the shift reporting schema:

## 📋 Step 1: Access Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Login to your account
3. Select project: `mogjjvscxjwvhtpkrlqr`

## 📋 Step 2: Open SQL Editor
1. In the left sidebar, click on "SQL Editor"
2. Click "New Query" button

## 📋 Step 3: Copy & Execute Schema
1. Open the file: `shift_reporting_schema.sql`
2. Copy the entire content
3. Paste it into the SQL Editor
4. Click "Run" button

## 📋 Step 4: Verify Deployment
After running the SQL, verify these tables were created:
- ✅ shift_sessions
- ✅ shift_transactions  
- ✅ shift_inventory
- ✅ shift_expenses
- ✅ shift_reports

## 📋 Step 5: Test RLS Policies
Run this query to test Row Level Security:
```sql
SELECT table_name, policy_name 
FROM information_schema.row_security_policies 
WHERE table_name LIKE 'shift_%';
```

## 🎯 Expected Results
You should see policies for all shift tables ensuring:
- Club owners can manage all shift data
- Staff can only access their own shifts
- Proper access control for sensitive financial data

## 🔧 If You Encounter Errors
Common issues and solutions:
1. **Table already exists**: Drop existing tables first
2. **Permission denied**: Ensure you're logged in as project owner
3. **Function errors**: Check if required extensions are enabled

## 📞 Need Help?
If deployment fails, the schema is also available in the repository at:
`/workspaces/saboarenav3/shift_reporting_schema.sql`

## ✅ Next Steps After Deployment
Once schema is deployed successfully:
1. Flutter app will automatically connect to new tables
2. Shift reporting features will be enabled
3. Club owners can start managing shift data
4. Staff can track daily revenue and expenses
